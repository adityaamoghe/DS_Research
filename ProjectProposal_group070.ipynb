    "Academic performance is a critical factor towards a person's overall academic success. Maximizing ones academic success could better one's carreer and state of life with the opportunities schooling provides. Our group is highly interested in exercising and physical fitness; as college students looking to excel in our academic studies, we want to examine the effects of exercising on academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been extensive studies on the correlation between physical activity and academic performance amongst adolescents. One such study [^Castelli] found that physical activity is linked to higher academic performance as measured through standardized test scores, improved memory retention, and better engagement. The children studied had an enhanced learning experience when participating in physical activities. While this study was able to effectively correlate academics with exercise rates, the results were not applicable to college students. Our group aims to extend the findings to college student population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2017 study from the Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis[^Fricke] concluded that college students who were able to effectively integrate both excercise and studying into their daily regimen, showed far greater academic results than students who did not. However one confounding variable in the conducting of the study was that the researchers used incentives to encourage students to participate in the on campus activities. The findings were not able to distinguish whether it was excercise or spending more time at the educational facility that yielded in higher academic performance. Our group aims to refine this study and truly pinpoint whether there is a direct correlation to exercise rates and higher academic performance among college students.\n",

    "An ideal data set would have variables such as the amount of time spent exercising, type of exercise, grade point average of that person, and class standing. We would want a fairly high number of observations. This is because we want to avoid collecting less data that does not represent the entire target population correctly and recognize outliers in the dataset. We would like to collect our data from scholarly articles and surveys that are credible. We would like organize our data structurally and cleanly such that we remove any extraneous datapoints. In order to group and categorize data we will use one dataframe that consists of all our data and we do multiple analysis by splitting up the data into different categories such as gender, class standing, race, etc. \n",
